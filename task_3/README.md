Note taking app with online sync


### Key Considerations
- Completed with bonus features
- Used Drift for local database
- Didn't fully used Data, Domain, Presentation layer as I used Bloc
- Bloc handled all necessary clean architecture, so tried to avoid any overhead
- Created entities in Domain layer but didn't use it. Used drift's generated model


### Technologies Used
- Drift
- BLoC
